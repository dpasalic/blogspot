# **BLOGSPOT**  

## Mock app for making, sharing and exploring blogs  
This is my first big project and I put a lot of love in it.  
It is a web app with implemented CRUD operations for blogs and users using fake back-end. Focus was on making pixel perfect UI that looks great with smooth animations.  
&nbsp;
## Tech stack
- React (CRA)
- Redux
- Sass
- json-server
&nbsp;
## How to run the app
To run the app you need git, Node and npm installed on your machine.  

First clone the project to the desired directory
> `git clone https://github.com/dpasalic/blogspot.git  `

&nbsp;  
Next, move into project's api directory, install npm packages and start the server
> `cd blogspot/api`  
> `npm install`  
> `npm start`

&nbsp;  
Do the same for client directory
> `cd ../client`  
> `npm install`  
> `npm start`

&nbsp;  
Now open **localhost:3000/login** and explore.
